# 🙏 Do & Don't Top 10 for Cultural Highlights in Bangkok

### ✅ Do
1. **Cover shoulders and knees** – wear a t-shirt, light shirt, or dress/skirt below the knee.  
2. **Wear light fabrics** – cotton or linen keeps you cool in the heat.  
3. **Bring a scarf/shawl** – easy to cover shoulders when needed.  
4. **Slip-on shoes** – handy since you often remove shoes before entering temples.  
5. **Dress neatly** – simple, clean, and respectful always works.  

### ❌ Don’t
6. **No sleeveless tops** – tank tops and spaghetti straps are not accepted.  
7. **No short shorts or mini-skirts** – even in the heat, keep knees covered.  
8. **Avoid ripped or flashy clothes** – torn jeans, slogans, or party wear look disrespectful.  
9. **Don’t wear hats or sunglasses inside** – remove them when entering temple grounds.  
10. **No beachwear** – swimwear, crop tops, and flip-flops are a big no-go.

## 🌿 Local’s Alternative Top 10 in Bangkok

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own backyard — a mix of hip cafés, local street food, and chill bars. Great for people-watching and soaking up Bangkok’s creative expat + Thai scene.  

2. **Talad Rot Fai (Train Market, Srinakarin or Ratchada)**  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A retro-themed night market with vintage items, quirky bars, and endless street food. Less polished, more fun than tourist markets.  

3. **Bang Krachao – “The Green Lung”**  
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A massive artificial island full of greenery, bike paths, and stilted homes. Rent a bicycle, escape the city chaos, and ride along canals and gardens.

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edgy neighborhoods with indie art galleries, craft beer bars, and tucked-away eateries. Great for an evening out with a local vibe.  

5. **Charoen Krung Creative District**
