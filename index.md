## 🙏 Do & Don’t Top 10 for Cultural Highlights

**✅ Do**
1. Cover shoulders and knees – wear a t-shirt, light shirt, or dress/skirt below the knee.  
2. Wear light fabrics – cotton or linen keeps you cool in the heat.  
3. Bring a scarf/shawl – easy to cover shoulders when needed.  
4. Slip-on shoes – handy since you often remove shoes before entering temples.  
5. Dress neatly – simple, clean, and respectful always works.  

**❌ Don’t**
6. No sleeveless tops – tank tops and spaghetti straps are not accepted.  
7. No short shorts or mini-skirts – even in the heat, keep knees covered.  
8. Avoid ripped or flashy clothes – torn jeans, slogans, or party wear look disrespectful.  
9. Don’t wear hats or sunglasses inside – remove them when entering temple grounds.  
10. No beachwear – swimwear, crop tops, and flip-flops are a big no-go.
